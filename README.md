# Crush RISC-V Processor

## Tech stack

| Technology | Notes |
| ---        | ---   |
| Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005) | Picked over VHDL because there is better open source tooling available. |
| [verible](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible) | Standard LSP linter that can integrate with most text editors. |
| FuseSoC | Build tool that simplifies running the testbenches and synthesis tools. |
